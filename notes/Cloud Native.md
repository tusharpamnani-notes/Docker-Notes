# Cloud Native

- **Rapid Adoption:** Cloud native has quickly become a significant trend in the software industry.
- **New Approach:** It represents a new way of thinking about building complex systems, leveraging modern software development practices, technologies, and cloud infrastructure.
- **Open Source Community:** Widely embraced within open-source communities.

## Cloud Native Foundation Definition

- **Components:**
  - Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs.
- **Objectives:**
  - Enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable.
  - Robust automation facilitates frequent and predictable impactful changes.
- **Ecosystem:**
  - Consists of open-source, vendor-neutral projects.

## Cloud Native Concepts

### 1. Speed and Agility

- Focus on instantaneous responsiveness and up-to-the-minute features.
- Business benefits include accelerated innovation, rapid feature releases, and increased confidence in stability/performance.

### 2. Application Architecture

### 3. Mentality: Pets vs. Cattle

- Infrastructure becomes immutable and disposable.
- Provisioned quickly and destroyed on demand.
- Emphasis on re-provisioning rather than updating or repairing.

### 4. Cloud Native Trail Map

- Breaks down the journey into measurable objectives.
- Involves setting key performance indicators (KPIs).
  
  1. **Containerization**
  2. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
  3. **Orchestration and Application Definition**
  4. **Observability and Analysis**
  5. **Service Proxy, Discovery, and Mesh**
  6. **Networking, Policy, and Security**
